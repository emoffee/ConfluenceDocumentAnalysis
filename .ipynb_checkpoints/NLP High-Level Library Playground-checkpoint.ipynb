      "\u001b[32mPositive\u001b[0m ( subj: 0.00 ): White papers are also meant to help readers understand an issue, solve a problem, or make a decision.\n",
      "\u001b[32mPositive\u001b[0m ( subj: 0.17 ): White papers combine the objective/educational approach of an article and weave in the persuasive corporate messages typical of brochures.\n",

      "\u001b[31mNegative\u001b[0m ( subj: 0.04 ): The video may accomplish the same goal as a white paper, but the format in which it is presented disqualifies it from the white paper label.\n",

      "\u001b[31mNegative\u001b[0m ( subj: 0.17 ): Anything shorter is generally considered to be lacking the useful information that should be found in a white paper, and may be tossed aside as a sales pitch.\n",
      "\u001b[32mPositive\u001b[0m ( subj: 0.30 ): As the purpose of a white paper is generally to inform an audience about a complex issue, if your paper is too short, you may not accomplish this goal.\n",
