      "\u001b[32mPositive\u001b[0m (subj: 0.0 ): White papers are also meant to help readers understand an issue, solve a problem, or make a decision.\n",
      "\u001b[32mPositive\u001b[0m (subj: 0.16666666666666666 ): White papers combine the objective/educational approach of an article and weave in the persuasive corporate messages typical of brochures.\n",

      "Will my finished product be a written narrative?\n",
      "\u001b[32mPositive\u001b[0m (subj: 0.0 ): White papers are written reports.\n",

      "\u001b[31mNegative\u001b[0m (subj: 0.041666666666666664 ): The video may accomplish the same goal as a white paper, but the format in which it is presented disqualifies it from the white paper label.\n",

      "\u001b[32mPositive\u001b[0m (subj: 0.34 ): White papers are typically 6-8 pages long, but are at least 5-6 pages long.\n",
      "\u001b[31mNegative\u001b[0m (subj: 0.16666666666666666 ): Anything shorter is generally considered to be lacking the useful information that should be found in a white paper, and may be tossed aside as a sales pitch.\n",
      "\u001b[32mPositive\u001b[0m (subj: 0.3 ): As the purpose of a white paper is generally to inform an audience about a complex issue, if your paper is too short, you may not accomplish this goal.\n",

      "\u001b[31mNegative\u001b[0m (subj: 0.04 ): If you intend your document to be technical support for a product or service, you do not intend to write a white paper, because technical support is needed later in the sales cycle than a white paper is.\n",

      "\u001b[31mNegative\u001b[0m (subj: 0.26785714285714285 ): Your white paper, if done right, will paint you as a trusted advisor to the audience, not another business peddling their services.\n",

      "Blog posts are generally shorter than white papers.\n",
      "\u001b[31mNegative\u001b[0m (subj: 0.75 ): Blog posts can be sheer opinion.\n",
      "\u001b[31mNegative\u001b[0m (subj: 0.0 ): White papers must be based in facts and figures and be thoroughly researched.\n",
      "\u001b[32mPositive\u001b[0m (subj: 0.2 ): Blog posts take an individual several hours to write.\n",
      "\u001b[31mNegative\u001b[0m (subj: 0.0 ): White papers should take a team between 4 to 6 weeks of fulltime effort to write.\n",

      "Brochures are sales documents intended to create interest and desire.\n",

      "\u001b[31mNegative\u001b[0m (subj: 0.65 ): Brochures push emotional buttons like fear, greed, envy, and vanity.\n",
      "\u001b[32mPositive\u001b[0m (subj: 0.0 ): White papers appeal to logic.\n",
      "\u001b[32mPositive\u001b[0m (subj: 0.6 ): Brochures are colorful, flashy, and filled with promises about the product/service.\n",
      "\u001b[32mPositive\u001b[0m (subj: 0.05 ): White papers exist between technical manuals and brochures in design.\n",
      "\u001b[31mNegative\u001b[0m (subj: 0.25 ): Some audiences report being suspicious of flashy white papers.\n",
      "\u001b[31mNegative\u001b[0m (subj: 0.0 ): White papers should not be reformatted brochures.\n",
      "\u001b[32mPositive\u001b[0m (subj: 0.0 ): Audiences report feeling tricked if they read a white paper with the substance of an advertisement.\n",
      "\u001b[32mPositive\u001b[0m (subj: 0.0 ): This may damage your company's reputation.\n",
      "\u001b[31mNegative\u001b[0m (subj: 0.0 ): Brochures are a technique of advertising.\n",
      "\u001b[32mPositive\u001b[0m (subj: 0.0 ): While white papers are used in the sales cycle, they intend to position the issuing company as a trusted advisor to the audience, not as an advertisement agency for the issuing company.\n",

      "Case studies are extended testimonials on how a product or service has helped someone in the real world.\n",
      "\u001b[31mNegative\u001b[0m (subj: 0.025 ): White papers convey policy, present technical information, propose problems and offer solutions while sometimes offering testimonials; however, these testimonials are not the focus of the white paper.\n",
